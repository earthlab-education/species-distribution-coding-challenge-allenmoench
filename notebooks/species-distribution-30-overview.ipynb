        "A few reasons animals migrate include environmental reasons and reasons relating to their life cycle. Many animals in the northern hemisphere migrate south in the winter and north in the summer, for example. Many animals also migrate to mate, lay eggs, raise offspring, or satisfy some other aspect of their reproductive cycle. \n",

        "\n",
        "Climate change causes many alterations to environmental systems, which could throw off migration patterns in numerous and potentially unexpected ways. Some animals might be affected directly by temperature, for example if they typically migrate north to find cooler climates in the summer, they might have to migrate further north to find the same comfortable temperatures. Other creatures might change their migration patterns in ways that are less predictable. For example, if the patterns of ocean currents are altered by added fresh water from polar ice melt, migration routes of a wide variety of different creatures might be affected.\n",

        "In Boulder, CO there are a number of migratory animals that pass through the area. Canada geese and monarch butterflies are two examples - the geese migrate north and south with the change of the seasons, and the monarchs make a multi-generational journey to Mexico as part of their mating and life cycle. I believe many of Colorado’s ruminants - elk, deer, moose, and mountain goats - also migrate north and south with the seasons, although I don’t know the details of the routes they use."
